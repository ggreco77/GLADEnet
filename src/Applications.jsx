          <p>
            GLADEnet will assist in selecting the observational strategy based
            on galaxy completeness. For instance, it may recommend covering the
            entire sky region with wide-field telescopes when the completeness
            coefficient is low or targeting galaxies with smaller fields of view
            telescopes when the completeness coefficient is high.

          <p>
            GLADEnet can identify sky regions that are currently less observed
            or incomplete and suggest them as targets for survey observations to
            increase catalogue completeness.

            The completeness evaluation by GLADEnet can be used to correctly
            estimate the probability that observed galaxies are the actual hosts
            of the GW source.
